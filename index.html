    <h2>What is Space Law?</h2>
    <div class="intro-content">
      <img src="what is space law.jpg" alt="Space Law Treaties and Principles" class="intro-image" />
      <p>Space Law is the set of international rules and principles that govern how countries and private companies can explore and use outer space. Just like we have laws for land, sea, and air, space law ensures that space activities are peaceful, safe, and fair for everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <div class="intro-content">
      <img src="how does it work.jpg" alt="International treaties" class="intro-image" />
      <p>Space Law is mainly based on treaties created by the United Nations, especially the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. These treaties set the legal framework for all space activities, including launching satellites, protecting astronauts, avoiding space debris, and managing space resources. Countries that sign these treaties agree to follow the rules and work together to ensure that space remains a safe and peaceful place.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <div class="intro-content">
      <img src="why is it important.webp" alt="Debris from Satellite Destroyed by India" class="intro-image" />
      <p>It prevents conflicts by clearly defining what is allowed in space. It protects astronauts and space missions. It manages liability in case a satellite crashes or causes damage. It encourages international cooperation in science, exploration, and technology. It ensures that space remains a global common, accessible to all countries.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What has it achieved so far?</h3>
    <div class="intro-content">
      <img src="what has it achieved so far.jpg" alt="Mining in Space" class="intro-image" />
      <p>Since the 1960s, space law has helped avoid military use of space (no nuclear weapons in orbit), protected astronauts as "envoys of humankind", made it possible for countries to safely launch thousands of satellites, created a system for registering space objects and solving disputes peacefully, and inspired new discussions about space mining, tourism, and sustainability.</p>

      <h3 class="treaty-title">Outer Space Treaty (1967)</h3>
      <p>Space must be used for peaceful purposes. No country can own the Moon or other celestial bodies. Nuclear weapons are banned in space. States are internationally responsible for all space activities.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="rescue" class="treaty-content hidden">
      <h3 class="treaty-title">Rescue Agreement(1968)</h3>
      <p>Astronauts in distress must be rescued and returned to their home country. Space objects that land in foreign territory must be returned to the launching state.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="liability" class="treaty-content hidden">
      <h3 class="treaty-title">Liability Convention (1972)</h3>
      <p>The launching country is fully liable for damage caused by its space objects on Earth. This treaty provides a legal framework for compensation in case of accidents.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="registration" class="treaty-content hidden">
      <h3 class="treaty-title">Registration Convention (1976)</h3>
      <p>Requires countries to register every object they launch into space. It created a public international record maintained by the United Nations.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="moon" class="treaty-content hidden">
      <h3 class="treaty-title">Moon Agreement (1979)</h3>
      <p>Declared the Moon and its resources as the "common heritage of mankind". Suggested international rules for future resource exploitation. <em>*Very few countries have signed it.*</em></p>

  <section id="failures">
    <h2>Failures of Space Law</h2>
    <p>Despite the progress made, Space Law still faces many challenges. There are gaps in current treaties, such as the lack of clear rules for commercial exploration, asteroid mining, and space debris management. In addition, many countries have not ratified the main treaties, making global regulation difficult and inconsistent.</p>
    <p>Even though there are many treaties that aim to regulate space activities, one of the biggest issues is the difficulty in identifying and holding parties accountable for damages in outer space. Even though the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention address responsibility for damage caused in space, enforcement is weak and rarely applied. In many cases, it is hard to determine who is truly responsible.</p>
    <p>For example, in 2019, India destroyed one of its own satellites during a missile test, generating hundreds of pieces of debris that still threaten other satellites in orbit. Despite the clear risk created, no accountability was enforced. Similarly, in 2021, Russia conducted an anti-satellite missile test that destroyed one of its own defunct satellites, generating thousands of dangerous debris fragments. The international community condemned the action, but no legal consequences were imposed on Russia.</p>

     <h2>Satellites and Debris Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline-section">
      <p>The growing number of satellites and space debris is a serious challenge for space law. As more objects fill Earth’s orbit, the risk of collisions increases, threatening satellites we depend on for communication, navigation, and science. Current treaties, like the Outer Space Treaty, are outdated and don’t offer clear rules for debris removal or satellite traffic. This creates legal uncertainty and makes long-term space sustainability harder to manage. Space law must evolve to handle this new reality, before orbit becomes too crowded or dangerous to use.</p>
