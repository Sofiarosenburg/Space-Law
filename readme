# Space Law Project

Welcome to the repository for my Space Law Project.  
This project is part of my initiative to explore how international law can — and should — govern human activity in outer space. It connects legal studies with scientific understanding, focusing on real challenges and future scenarios.

## About

As space exploration becomes more frequent and commercialized, legal frameworks must evolve to handle issues like:

- International Treaties: Understanding foundational documents like the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Moon Agreement (1979), and others that set the rules for space use, exploration, and demilitarization.
- Space Debris: Studying the growing problem of orbital junk, including risks to satellites, the environment, and human missions.
- Asteroid Mining: Exploring the legal gray areas of extracting resources from celestial bodies — who owns them? What rights do countries or companies have?
- Future Regulation: Thinking ahead — should we create a new global space agency or treaty? How do we ensure fair and peaceful use of outer space?

## How to Use

This repository is a living document. You can:

- Read: Go through my research summaries, infographics, and notes  
- Reflect: Take notes, ask questions, and think critically  
- Update: Follow the timeline of discoveries, proposals, and feedback as the project evolves  
- Explore: Check the links section to dive deeper into treaties, agencies, and current debates

## Project Goals

- Make complex space law topics easier to understand  
- Show how law and science interact in space governance  
- Propose a new global space regulation agency concept  
- Raise awareness of the urgent need to regulate space activity
