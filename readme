# Space Law Project

Welcome to the repository for my Space Law Project.  
This project is part of my initiative to explore how international law can — and should — govern human activity in outer space. It connects legal studies with scientific understanding, focusing on real challenges and future scenarios.

## About
As space exploration becomes more frequent and commercialized, legal frameworks must evolve to handle issues like:
- International Treaties: Understanding foundational documents like the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Moon Agreement (1979), and others that set the rules for space use, exploration, and demilitarization.
- Space Debris: Studying the growing problem of orbital junk, including risks to satellites, the environment, and human missions.
- Asteroid Mining: Exploring the legal gray areas of extracting resources from celestial bodies — who owns them? What rights do countries or companies have?
- Future Regulation: Thinking ahead — should we create a new global space agency or treaty? How do we ensure fair and peaceful use of outer space?
- This project is an educational website about Space Law, exploring international treaties, orbital pollution, asteroid mining, and the importance of global regulation.
- Its goal is to make Space Law accessible and highlight how legal frameworks are essential for sustainable space exploration.

## How to Use
This repository is a living document. You can:
- Read: Go through my research summaries, infographics, and notes  
- Reflect: Take notes, ask questions, and think critically  
- Update: Follow the timeline of discoveries, proposals, and feedback as the project evolves  
- Explore: Check the links section to dive deeper into treaties, agencies, and current debates

## Purpose 
- I made this project because I believe that as humanity expands into space, laws must evolve to protect outer space as a common good.
- Coming from a place where women in STEM often face challenges, I also wanted to prove that I can contribute to this field and inspire others to follow paths that combine science, law, and ethics.

## Process
- The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clarity and accessibility.
- I researched official documents such as the Outer Space Treaty and recent discussions about space debris and resource exploitation, and then translated this into an interactive and easy-to-understand format.

## Challenges
- Understanding and simplifying complex legal documents.
- Deciding what information was essential to include.
- Creating a timeline about satellites and orbital debris, since it was challenging to organize technical data in a way that looked clear and engaging.

## Learnings
- I learned how to communicate legal and scientific topics in a way that is clear and engaging.
- I improved my research and summarization skills by working with treaties and regulations.
- I gained a deeper understanding of how law and science interact in the context of space exploration.
